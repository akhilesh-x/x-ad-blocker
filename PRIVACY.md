# Privacy Policy for X Ad Blocker

Last Updated: April 20, 2025

## Overview

X Ad Blocker is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the extension works and our approach to data handling.

## Data Collection: None

**We collect absolutely no data.**

- No personal information
- No browsing history
- No tracking of any kind
- No analytics
- No unique identifiers

## How the Extension Works

X Ad Blocker works completely client-side in your browser. It:

1. Runs only on X.com and Twitter.com domains
2. Scans the page for elements that match ad patterns
3. Modifies the display of these elements locally in your browser
4. Stores your preferences (show placeholders or not) using Chrome's built-in storage API, which keeps this information only on your device

## Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party services, analytics tools, or external APIs. The extension never makes network requests to external servers.

## Required Permissions

- **storage**: Used only to store your preference for showing placeholders
- **host permissions for twitter.com and x.com**: Required to run the content script only on these domains

## Changes to This Policy

Any future changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted here. The extension will remain privacy-focused and will never collect user data.
